# Brunch Toolchain 0.1.1

## Introduction

This is a toolchain that leverages [Brunch](http://brunch.io) and cake tasks. It can be used for skeletons.


## Requirements
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (mandatory)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation) (recommended via npm)


## Setup
1. Install node.js.
2. While not mandatory, it is recommended to install CoffeeScript.
3. Download this skeleton.
4. Open a Terminal / Command Prompt and navigate to this directory where you downloaded the skeleton.
5. Execute the command `npm install` to install all package dependencies.


## Command List
While Brunch commands can be used, cake commands are provided for this skeleton. These tasks can be executed using cake if it is installed. (`cake [command]`) If cake is not installed these commands can also be executed using npm. (`npm run-script [command]`) These are the following commands (this list is accessible using either the command `cake` or `npm start`):

### Building
These commands are used to assemble the application, generating the necessary JS/CSS and adding assets. Use `dev` mode to keep readable JS/CSS and include tests under the `test/` folder. Use `prod` mode to minify/uglify JS/CSS and omit tests.

#### `build:[mode]`
Assemble the application once.

#### `watch:[mode]`
Assemble the application and continue to watch for changes. Rebuild every time a change is detected.

#### `server:[mode]`
Assemble the application and continue to watch for changes. Rebuild every time a change is detected. Also, the application is served locally to open with a browser. This build uses the `web` environment.
